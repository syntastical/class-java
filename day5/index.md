# Final Project
Create a text based adventure game that prompts the users with multiple choices.  Each choice should
have a unique outcome on the game.  User input should be validated and reprompt the player if an 
invalid input is given. Feel free to add any game mechanics you want (battles, random events, etc). 
As people finish, we will swap computers and play each others games.

# Example
```text
You come to a fork in the road
1) One path leads to a dark forest filled with man eating dragons.
2) The other path leads thru a kingdom of friendly kittens, however you're deathly allergic to cat hair.
Which do you choose?
